# Shield-OS
A Operating System… That’s it, no promises

You run it with the command 
qemu-system-x86_64 -fda build/main_floppy.img

If you are a viewer using this for god knows why, use the run command after downloading the build folder, thats the only neccessary one, u can get the others if you want to try and tweak the code

If you are a collabarater, then download the whole folder

DISCLAMER: NO MATTER WHAT, DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR REAL SYSTEM, ALSO USE A VIRTUAL MACHINE, DO NOT EVEN DUAL BOOT WITH THIS.
